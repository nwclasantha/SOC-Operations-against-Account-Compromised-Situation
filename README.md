#### Introduction

In today’s cyber-threat landscape, organizations face increasing risks of account compromises due to credential theft, phishing attacks, brute force attempts, and other malicious activities. A compromised account can act as a gateway for attackers to infiltrate deeper into an organization’s infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational harm. An effective incident response workflow for account compromise ensures that organizations can identify, contain, and remediate threats promptly. This article presents a structured approach to handling account compromise incidents by covering all critical stages: detection, analysis, containment and eradication, recovery, and post-incident actions.

#### Objectives

The primary goals of an account compromise incident response plan include:

1. **Early Detection**: Quickly detect and confirm account compromises to limit the potential impact.
2. **In-depth Analysis**: Identify the extent of the breach, assess affected assets, and determine the root cause.
3. **Efficient Containment and Eradication**: Prevent further spread of the threat and remove malicious access.
4. **Comprehensive Recovery**: Safely restore systems and services to a secure state.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from each incident to improve defenses and prevent similar occurrences.

Achieving these objectives requires a well-defined incident response framework that aligns with the organization’s security policies and regulatory requirements.

#### Security Requirements

A successful incident response strategy for account compromises requires the following security measures:

1. **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: This system collects, correlates, and analyzes security data across an organization’s infrastructure to detect suspicious activities.
2. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: EDR solutions provide real-time endpoint visibility, detect malware and suspicious behaviors, and allow for endpoint isolation if necessary.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA adds a layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond a username and password, making unauthorized access more difficult.
4. **Network Security Controls**: Firewalls, proxies, and network access control systems are essential to enforce policies and block unauthorized traffic.
5. **Regular Backup and Restore Mechanism**: Reliable and secure backups enable organizations to restore critical data after an incident.
6. **Security Documentation and Playbooks**: Policies, playbooks, and runbooks provide clear protocols and step-by-step guides for incident handling.
7. **User Awareness Training**: Training programs educate users about recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks, which can reduce the likelihood of initial compromise.

#### Incident Response Workflow

The incident response workflow for account compromises is divided into five stages. Each stage includes detailed actions, roles, and decisions to efficiently manage the incident.

### 1. Detection

![AccountCompromised-Workflow-Detect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675b51ff-52f3-422a-a917-6269a48884c6)

In this phase, organizations detect and confirm suspicious activity related to account compromises. The steps include:

- **Alerts and Notifications**: Initial alerts can come from monitoring tools, user reports, third-party providers, or automated systems. For example, alerts might include failed login attempts, unusual account activity, or unexpected application access.
  
- **Identify Threat Indicators**: Analyze specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), such as anomalous login locations, IP addresses, or devices. Check for malware delivery, credential theft, and other suspicious signs.
  
- **Identify Risk Factors**: Assess the severity of the incident, considering potential financial losses, regulatory implications, and reputational damage.
  
- **Data Collection**: Gather all relevant information about the incident, including threat data, file hashes, IP addresses, and any related domains.
  
- **Triage and Initial Assessment**: Determine the impact, whether the malware is proliferating, and assess if it’s a false positive. This triage step decides if the incident proceeds to the next phase.

*Outcome*: The incident is either confirmed as a legitimate compromise or dismissed as a false positive.

Once an incident is confirmed, the analysis phase involves a thorough investigation to understand the compromise's scope and impact.

- **Verification**: Revalidate alerts and indicators to confirm the incident’s legitimacy and rule out any false positives.
  
- **List Affected Credentials**: Compile a list of accounts impacted by the incident, noting access levels and user roles.
  
- **Assess Access Level and Privileges**: Identify the level of privileges associated with the compromised account(s). For instance, assess if the account has domain admin rights, which could result in a wider impact.
  
- **Critical Incident Determination**: Decide if the incident is critical, which may activate a more extensive incident response playbook.
  
- **Scope Validation and Threat Actor Analysis**: Determine if there is evidence of an advanced persistent threat (APT) or live threat actor actively targeting the organization.
  
- **Password Management and Exfiltration Checks**: Verify if the attacker compromised MFA, reused passwords, or accessed sensitive data.

*Outcome*: A full understanding of the incident scope, with insights into affected assets and the attacker's activities, enabling effective containment.

In this stage, organizations work to isolate and remove the threat from their environment.

- **Disable Compromised Accounts**: Lock down affected accounts to stop unauthorized access and prevent further damage.
  
- **Reset Passwords**: Mandate password resets for all compromised accounts, including domain, local, and multi-factor credentials.
  
- **Power Down Non-Encrypted Systems**: Safely shut down unencrypted systems to avoid data corruption and stop further compromise.
  
- **Restrict Privileges**: Limit access permissions to mitigate the potential damage from compromised accounts.
  
- **Block Network Traffic**: Prevent any further network communication from identified malicious IPs or endpoints.
  
- **Contain Endpoint**: Use EDR tools to isolate the infected endpoint from the network.

*Outcome*: The organization successfully isolates and removes the threat, ensuring that all access points have been neutralized.

After containment, the organization focuses on restoring systems and verifying that all malicious elements have been eradicated.

- **Update Defenses**: Re-enable firewall rules, proxy settings, and backup links that may have been disabled during containment.
  
- **Change All Passwords**: Change passwords for all affected accounts, including critical services, API keys, and network devices.
  
- **Remove Unauthorized Access Points**: Remove any compromised VPN connections, jump boxes, or third-party access.
  
- **Rebuild Systems**: Use clean backups to restore systems and apply any necessary patches or updates to ensure system integrity.
  
- **Audit and Secure Services**: Review internet-facing services to ensure all have MFA enabled and meet security requirements.

*Outcome*: Systems are back to a secure, operational state, ready for business as usual, with all known malicious access paths removed.

In this final phase, the organization reviews the incident to learn from it and strengthen its defenses.

- **Incident Review**: Discuss the incident response performance, identifying what worked well and what could be improved.
  
- **Update Policies and Procedures**: Revise any relevant policies, playbooks, and procedures to address gaps identified during the incident.
  
- **Review Defensive Posture**: Assess the current detection rules and update SIEM, EDR, and other monitoring systems to improve threat detection.
  
- **Modify Base Images and Implement New Detections**: Update operating system images, application versions, and detection rules to include relevant patches and protections.
  
- **User Awareness Training**: Conduct additional security training for users, especially if human error played a role in the compromise.
  
- **Calculate Financial Impact**: Document the cost of the incident, including remediation efforts, downtime, and other associated expenses.

*Outcome*: The organization leverages lessons learned to bolster its security framework, improve response capabilities, and minimize the risk of future incidents.
